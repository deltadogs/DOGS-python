# DOGS-python

A derivative-free global optimization algorithm based on Delaunay triangulation designed to solve efficiently the problems whose function evaluations process is inaccurate, but its accuracy can be improved by increasing its computational cost. This package particularly well-suited when the objective function is like a black-box function.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
You need to downlaod and install anaconda python 3 package:

```
https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos
```

## Installation
Clone the package into your workspace:

```
git clone https://github.com/deltadogs/DOGS-python/
```

And then 

```
cd DOGS-python
```


## Running the tests

Here is an example on Schewfel function. 

### Test demo


```
python dogsmain1.py
```
